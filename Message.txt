Message<T>:
    Header: [fixed size]
      - T Id (enum class) 
      - Size (bytes)
    Body: (0 or more bytes)

We can use int id, but in that case we have the problem to use incorrect id. For example we have 0,1,2, but send message with 
id = 5 or 10 or 154533. We will use enum class to validate id. But we want to give our users to ability to create their own
types of messages, (their own id), cause we don't know how many of types they needs. So we will use the templates.
